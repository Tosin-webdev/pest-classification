Control: Remove by hand if feasible, use neem oil or insecticidal soap.

### Spider Mites:

Symptoms: Webbing on leaves, stippling (tiny yellow or white spots), leaf discoloration. </br>
Control: Increase humidity, use horticultural oil, insecticidal soap, or predatory mites.

### Caterpillars:

Symptoms: Chewed leaves, frass (caterpillar droppings) on leaves and ground.</br>
Control: Handpick if possible, use Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), or botanical insecticides.

### Slugs and Snails:

Symptoms: Irregular holes in leaves, slime trails on the ground. </br>
Control: Handpick, create barriers like copper tape, use iron phosphate baits.

### Scale Insects:

Symptoms: Small, waxy bumps on stems and leaves, yellowing leaves, stunted growth. </br>
Control: Remove by hand or prune infested parts, use horticultural oil or neem oil.

### Thrips:

Symptoms: Silvering or bronzing of leaves, distorted growth, dark fecal deposits on leaves. </br>
Control: Use reflective mulches, insecticidal soap, or neem oil.

### Japanese Beetles:

Symptoms: Skeletonized leaves, presence of adult beetles on plants. </br>
Control: Handpick adult beetles, use row covers, traps, or insecticides.

### Leaf Miners:

Symptoms: Winding tunnels or mines on leaves, leaf discoloration. </br>
Control: Prune infested leaves, use yellow sticky traps, neem oil, or spinosad-based insecticides.
For effective pest management, consider adopting Integrated Pest Management (IPM) techniques, which combine multiple strategies to minimize environmental impact.

### Scales:
Symptoms: Small, immobile, waxy bumps on stems and leaves.</br>
Control: Remove by hand or prune infested parts, use horticultural oil, or neem oil.
### Leaf Spot Fungi:
Symptoms: Circular spots with different colors on leaves, premature leaf drop. </br>
Control: Remove affected leaves, ensure good air circulation, use fungicides if necessary.
### Powdery Mildew:
Symptoms: White, powdery coating on leaves and stems. </br>
Control: Improve air circulation, avoid overhead watering, use sulfur-based fungicides.
### Root Knot Nematodes:
Symptoms: Stunted growth, galls on roots, yellowing leaves. </br>
Control: Rotate crops, use nematode-resistant varieties, or apply beneficial nematodes.
### Cutworms:
Symptoms: Young plants cut off at the base, usually during the night.
Control: Use collars around seedlings, handpick, or apply Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt).
### Wireworms:
Symptoms: Yellowing, wilting, or stunted plants.
Control: Use traps, rotate crops, or apply beneficial nematodes.

Symptoms: Raised tunnels and mounds in the lawn or garden. </br>
Control: Use traps, remove their food source (insects), or install barriers.
### Voles:
Symptoms: Gnawed bark, damaged roots, runways in the grass. </br>
Control: Use traps, remove hiding places, or install barriers around trees.
### Tomato Hornworms:
Symptoms: Defoliation of tomato plants, green caterpillars with horns. </br>
Control: Handpick, use Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), or introduce natural predators.
### Cucumber Beetles:
Symptoms: Feeding damage on cucumber and squash leaves, yellowing. </br>
Control: Use row covers, handpick, or apply neem oil.
### Earwigs:
Symptoms: Holes in leaves and flowers, feeding at night. </br>
Control: Use traps, remove hiding places, or diatomaceous earth.
### Gophers:
Symptoms: Mounds of soil, damaged roots and underground plant parts.</br>
Control: Use traps, install barriers, or use gopher-resistant plants.

### Beet Armyworms:
Symptoms: Defoliation of various plants, webbing. </br>
Control: Handpick, use Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), or introduce natural predators.

Symptoms: Twisted, distorted leaves on citrus trees. </br>
Control: Prune affected leaves, use horticultural oil, or neem oil. 
### Sowbugs and Pillbugs:
Symptoms: Feeding damage on young seedlings, especially in damp areas. </br>
Control: Remove debris, increase air circulation, or use diatomaceous earth.
